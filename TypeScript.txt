TypeScript is super set to JavaScript. It offers more features than vanilla JS (e.g. types, Classes, Interfaces, ...)

TypeScript doesn't run in browser, so it is compiled to JavaScript in the end, this compilation is taken care by CLI. 

Technically, we can write Angular in JavaScript, but generally not done because of more features being offered by TS, to make the application we build more robust
